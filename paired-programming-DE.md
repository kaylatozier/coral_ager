## 1. Goals
The goal of the project is clear both in the README and proposal. You are developing
a replacment for the Ager tool to model isotope time-series type data.

## 2. Data
The data is clearly presented in the proposal. Since you have some example data 
files you could even link to them in your proposal. Will most users have their
own data files for both types on input? Or is the depth ~ climate data something
where everyone reuses some standard dataset? If it is the latter, perhaps that data
should be automatically stored/fetched by the program, rather than requiring the
user to get and enter it.

## 3. Code
The simulation code looks like a good start. The formatting of the Python module needed
some improvements. I committed some changes to move the imports, fix a typo, and add some
expected formatting comments.
