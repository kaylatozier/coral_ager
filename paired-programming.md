**1. Goal of the project:**

**Is it clear to you from the `proposal.md` how the goal can be accomplished using Python and the specified packages?**

No, the proposal doesn't show the the detailed about the required python packages, but in the README file it shows that `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib` packages are required.

**2. The Data:**

**Is it clear to you from the `proposal.md` what the data for this project is, or will look like?**

The instructions for user input are great. Maybe adding some example outputs will be better.

**3. The code:**

**Does the current code include a proper skeleton (pseudocode) for starting this project?**

Yes.

**What can this code do so far?**
- Generate synthetic datasets for coral δ¹⁸O and SST.  
- Incorporate long-term trends (warming trend for SST, isotope trend for δ¹⁸O).  
- Save the generated data in tab-delimited files.  
- Plot the datasets for visualization.  

**Given the project description, what are some individual functions that could be written to accomplish parts of this goal?**

The functions may be broken down into smaller, reusable functions.

For example:

- `add_noise(data, scale=0.1)`
Adds random Gaussian noise to a dataset.

- `save_dataframe(df, filename, sep="\t")`
Saves a DataFrame to a file with a specified delimiter.

- `plot_d18o(depths, values, location)` and  `plot_sst(dates, temps, location)`
For visualization.
